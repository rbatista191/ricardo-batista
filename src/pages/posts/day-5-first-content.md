I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.  

You have to create content if you want your product/service to rank. In the past this meant writing for yourself (or hiring for that), nowadays you can get started with AI content. Itâ€™s a bit controversial, but it works - see attached the typical trajectory. I donâ€™t advise anyone to copy-paste the output verbatim, but edit according to your taste.

You can start for yourself using any AI tool, however you probably wonâ€™t get good enough content to rank. A great article has a proper structure, 2000-3000 words, with Key Takeaways, FAQs, Conclusion AND internal linking (this last is crucial). 

Here I strongly recommend using a good service/product:
- Journalist AI
- SEObotAI
- [AI Blog Articles](https://getaiblogarticles.com/)
I am biased here because I built AI Blog Articles, but it is one of the best I have seen. It was done with the best practices of SEO and generated clicks as you see attached.

Tomorrow letâ€™s talk about massively add backlinks!
