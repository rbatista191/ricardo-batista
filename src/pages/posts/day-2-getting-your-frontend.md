I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.

Minimize the effort in putting a page up, here are some fast, cheap and effortless options:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) is a fast react framework, you can select FREE templates straight from [astro.build/themes](https://astro.build/themes/). You can easily pick one up and deploy using Cloudflare Pages (which automatically recognizes the Astro folder structure)

- [OpenSaas](https://opensaas.sh/) is a full boilerplate (frontend, backend, server), totally free and using a simple config framework called @WaspLang. It includes extensive guides to deploy easily, my favourite is [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) for its simplicity and low price (~10$/month)

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is another simple and free boilerplate, a bit like Astro. It comes with a very easy config file to get started in minutes. Also easily deployable in Cloudflare Pages. Ready-to-deploy templates at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
