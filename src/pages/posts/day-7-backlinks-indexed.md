I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.  

During the first few months of building backlinks, I thought “ok, I do this and they will come”. But links take weeks, months or even never get crawled. These days the web is so wide that most of the websites don’t get crawled unless specifically requested by the owner through an indexer (most use the Google Indexing API).

The issue is that you can’t control the indexing of other websites to ensure your backlinks are crawled. But there are ways to force it (although results are not ensured):
- higher certainty / higher effort / zero cost: post every new backlink on your website or social media. After that, request indexing to your website through Google Search Console or any other tool ([remember one of my last posts?](/posts/day-3-marketing-tools/))
- medium certainty/ low effort / small cost: use OmegaIndexer or OneHourIndex, providing a list of links and they will do the job for you. It costs typically $20 for a thousand links, 7-15 days to get recognized. The services create links in their networks of sites that get scrapped often. It is not guaranteed, but again none of the methods are.

Tomorrow let’s talk about technical SEO: if you don’t do it right, all that previous effort is worthless!
