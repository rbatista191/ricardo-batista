I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.  

Links to unavailable pages signal lack of maintenance on your content, make sure to fix them ASAP:
1. Get Ahrefs’s free Site Audit tool ([sign up here](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools))
2. Run the first crawl in your website with the standard definitions
3. Go to the 404 errors and fix them one by one, both for external and internal links.

**Pro tip:** Ahrefs has two cool features in the Project Settings:
1. Go to the Project settings, tab Site Audit, tab Crawl Settings
2. Enable IndexNow for one-click indexing (you need to add a small .txt in your /public directory)
3. Enable PageSpeed Insights to get the Core Vitals straight from the Google API.

Tomorrow let’s talk again about technical SEO and address redirects!
