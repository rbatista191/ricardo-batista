Today we are launching [Tramitit](https://tramitit.com/), a shared database on getting all those poor-UX local procedures done in a much simpler way!

How it works: The community provides detailed walkthroughs on every possible bureaucratic process you might go through.
For the community by the community: The content on this website is curated, verified, and rated by the community.
Welcoming providers that can help our users: Although our guides are as simple as possible, users may still prefer to delegate tasks to a curated provider.
We are in a bit a chicken & egg problem: for the traffic to pick up and have contributors, we need to start by adding some content - some of which we have already gone through and fixed it, other not yet there. We will get there over time, and work with providers that can also bring the quality up.

You can find our [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/tramitit/guides), where you can contribute as well!
Our [website is also open-source](https://github.com/tramitit/tramitit.github.io), so feel free to add anything.
