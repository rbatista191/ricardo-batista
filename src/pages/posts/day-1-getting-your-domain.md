I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products. The screenshot shows the growth of one of them 📈

It will be a mix of technical and non-technical learnings, starting from the beginning of building. They are by no means the only answer, so I invite you all to contribute - let’s build THE knowledge base to get started.

Today it will be about domain choice:

- There are plenty of registrars, but I stuck to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/): it is more expensive (~10-15%), but you buy the domain and it’s already on Cloudflare (which is my preferred DNS provider, why below)

- Go for .com: there is plenty of talk about whether the .com’s got less relevant, but almost every user defaults mentally to .com when they remember their brand. You’re starting out, so your budget is limited - go for a word composition (e.g., get{your brand}.com). Later you build the real deal 🙂

- Why Cloudflare? I will cover it in a separate post, but it has a lot of mechanisms in place to protect your website from attacks, it has a very generous free plan for frontend hosting, and right now you can use their AI Workers for free (in the majority of the models).

Tomorrow let’s talk about getting the website up and running!
