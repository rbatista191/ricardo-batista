I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.

Stay lean and rely on two tools:

### Google Search Console
1) Sign in to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2) Enter your websiteâ€™s domain
3) Verify your domains (a few DNS providers are integrated for easier setup)
4) Submit your sitemap under Sitemaps
5) Use [@goenning](https://x.com/goenning)â€™s [open-source indexing tool](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script) to fast-track new page indexing by Google

### Ahrefs Webmaster Tool
1. Sign up in [ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools)
2. Enter your website domain
3. The free tool gives you a view over backlinks (see attached pic) and letâ€™s you perform a very SEO-thorough Site Audit (optimize for 90-100 and youâ€™re fine)

There are other great tools (SEMRush, UberSuggest) but I would stick to these for a great-enough performance.

Tomorrow letâ€™s talk about your first backlinks!
