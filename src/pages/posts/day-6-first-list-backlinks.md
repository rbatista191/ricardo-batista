I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.  

SEO is a function of backlinks and content. Let’s cover backlinks:

- the best backlinks are earned (press releases, organic mentions, etc.): for these, try HARO tools, contact directly the relevant blogs for your website to be included - it takes longer to earn these.

- the second best backlinks are produced (social websites, directories, etc.): you can get started with these today! I recommend using [@philkellr](https://x.com/philkellr)’s [backl.io/directory](https://backl.io/directory), complemented by [@ConnorShowler](https://x.com/ConnorShowler)’s X feed (which I have collect in a table in [ricardobatista.me/sneakybacklinks](https://ricardobatista.me/sneakybacklinks))

Start today building links, since their effect takes weeks/months to be recognized.

Tomorrow let’s talk about how to fast-track these backlinks’ recognition by the search engines!
