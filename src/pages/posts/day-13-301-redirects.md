I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.

When writing blog articles, often the outgoing links get updated and leads to a 301 redirect. While it is not a big deal for Google to crawl them, it signals your blog might not be frequently updated.

I fixed this problem with a simple Python script, and [published it for everyone](https://gist.github.com/rbatista191/a577063b743c32b89b2e51f9ec93b4ea).

Tomorrow letâ€™s talk about getting the metatags right!
