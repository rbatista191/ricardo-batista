I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.  

Your first backlinks should be **social accounts**. This will signal to the search engines that you exist - even though they donâ€™t pass SEO juice. Also, you reserve the handles to yourself in case someone wants to impersonate your business. 

Start by the following (with the direct links to create an account): 
- [Google My Business](https://business.google.com/create)
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/pages/creation)
- [Instagram](https://business.instagram.com/getting-started)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/setup/new/)
- [Crunchbase](https://crunchbase.com/add-new)
- [X](https://x.com/signup)

**Pro tip**: Include these links in your website to create a network of links. This helps the search engines recognize new backlinks. On recognizing backlinks, I will have a separate post in the next days.  

Tomorrow letâ€™s talk about your first piece of content!
