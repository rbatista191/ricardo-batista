One month back I wrote about [what I learned building Emilio](/posts/what-have-I-learnt-from-Emilio/), and a few updates have resurfaced. 

Emilio is shutting down. Against my will, my previous co-founder Daniel decided to shut down the service, removing all the permissions I had on the technical project. Through several intimidatory emails he has been trying to get the business platforms permissions for him, which I vehemently denied to avoid him harming our customers.

But he still did. And now the [Emilio](https://getemil.io/) customers are denied the service they paid for, some for a full year. I have been trying to understand the full rationale of Daniel's behaviour for a few months. I genuinely think he is a smart person, probably one of the smartest I know. I see two angles here:

1. **(the ugly one) He saw an angle to hijack the company because he didn't see the value in my work.** I definitely wouldn't do it the way he did (hijacking), but it is a way of doing it. The issue is that the work we did together cannot be transferred elsewhere without an agreement on the intellectual property of what we built.

2. **(the pretty one) He wanted out but didn't know how to handle it.** It was probably the worst way of handling it. And I told him multiple times we can let go of ego and solve this, but he brought lawyers instead of empathy.

I truly wish him the best. It sounds contradictory to my previous words, but I genuinely think he is a great and smart guy, that has a lot of potential - and I hope he lives up to it. This will all be a mistep in his life, and I hope he understands this is possibly the worst way of handling things.

As for me, I will continue building. I will make sure there is governance to protect the company from weird co-founder attitudes, but this only made me stronger.
