I am sharing every day a lesson I learned while building my last products.

When starting your SEO journey, I NEED to start via long-tail keywords. Why?
- lower traffic but also lower competition
- long-tail keyword also rank for short-tail keywords
- more depth in the content you’re creating

Tools to get started:
- [ahrefs.com/keyword-generator](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator): search for keywords and their difficulty
- [getaiblogarticles.com/long-tail-keyword-generator](https://getaiblogarticles.com/long-tail-keyword-generator): give your URL or product description and a list of keywords are generated for you

Tomorrow let’s talk again site speed!
