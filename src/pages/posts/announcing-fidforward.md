ðŸš€ Launching FidForward! ðŸš€

Today, Bernardo and I are excited to launch FidForward in private beta! We're looking for companies with 10-50 employees willing to pilot the next generation of performance management.

With two pilot programs already running successfully (achieving a 30-50% improvement in eNPS), weâ€™re eager to expand FidForward to more companies to validate these results further.

If youâ€™re a founder seeking to implement performance management or a larger company aiming to elevate your current system, please reach out to me!
